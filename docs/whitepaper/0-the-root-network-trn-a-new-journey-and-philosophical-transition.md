The Root Network (TRN) was born as one of **Futureverse’s core infrastructure and compatibility contributors** — the technological layer that enabled interoperability within the metaverse.

Futureverse’s long-term vision and philosophy provided TRN with its foundational principles and technical DNA, which later evolved into the concept of a **Liquidity Intelligence Economy**.

Today, TRN begins its **second chapter** as a **community-driven decentralized network** beyond a single-company ecosystem.

While preserving Futureverse’s legacy of openness and sustainability, TRN is rebuilding itself into a self-sustaining financial system where **capital circulates, liquidity is dynamic, and participants are empowered.**

This transformation carries forward Futureverse’s belief in open, composable, and sustainable economies while introducing a new architecture that attracts multiple stakeholders — builders, investors, and users — through an on-chain liquidity-driven economic framework.
