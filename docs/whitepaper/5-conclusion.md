The Root Network inherits Futureverse’s core philosophy while advancing into a fully **decentralized liquidity-intelligence economy.**

ROOT serves as the central engine of this system — powering capital circulation, profit distribution, and autonomous governance.

Through the synergy of **Vault → Treasury → Governance**, TRN achieves a self-sustaining economic model where capital, technology, and community coexist.

> “An on-chain liquidity intelligence economy — where Vaults create value, the Treasury circulates it, and Governance evolves it.”
