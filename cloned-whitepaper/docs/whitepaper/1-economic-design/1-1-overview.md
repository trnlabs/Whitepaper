ROOT is the **core liquidity and governance token** of the TRN ecosystem.

Users deposit ROOT into Vaults, contributing capital that powers the network.

Vaults autonomously deploy this capital across **on-chain financial strategies**, including:

1. Decentralized lending and liquidity provisioning,
2. Automated yield optimization and neutral-market strategies,
3. Market-making and asset stabilization mechanisms.

All yields generated from Vaults are aggregated by the TRN Treasury and redistributed through **buybacks, burns, rewards, and reinvestments.**

ROOT therefore acts as the **fuel** that keeps the entire TRN economy circulating.
